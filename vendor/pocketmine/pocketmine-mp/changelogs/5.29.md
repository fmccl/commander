# 5.29.0
Released 18th June 2025.

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.90.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.90.
- Removed support for earlier versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed thread crashes sometimes not reporting proper cause information in crashdumps.
- Fixed crash when a plugin replaced a player's held tool with a different tool with a damage exceeding the old tool's max damage during an action.
- Fixed performance issue of `PlayerAuthInputPacket` input flags handling (broken change detection).
- Fixed `BaseInventory->addItem()` triggering updates on empty slots when no items were added.
- Fixed slow check in `SubChunk` block layer garbage collection.

## Internals
- `LoginPacketHandler->processLogin()` signature has changed. This will break any plugins overriding `LoginPacketHandler`. As noted above, this is _not_ covered by the API version guarantee.
- Automated branch sync for `minor-next` and `major-next` is now triggered by `repository_dispatch` from a cron job in this repository instead of `RestrictedActions`. The `RestrictedActions` cron job was getting automatically disabled by GitHub due to repo inactivity.
