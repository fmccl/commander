# 5.28.0
Released 9th May 2025.

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.80.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.80.
- Removed support for earlier versions.

## Fixes
- `AvailableEnchantmentRegistry` now requires provided tags to always be `string`. Previously, this wasn't enforced, leading to random crashes in core code related to enchanting.
- `Entity->setFireTicks()` and `Entity->setOnFire()` now truncate the fire time to the max value instead of throwing exceptions.

## Internals
- Improved PHPStan error reporting for unsafe foreaches. Foreach on an array with implicit keys now generates different errors than foreach on an array with string keys.

# 5.28.1
Released 17th May 2025.

## Fixes
- Fixed errors when PlayStation players attempt to join due to null `TitleID`.

# 5.28.2
Released 17th May 2025.

## Fixes
- Fixed version constraints which were incorrectly updated during the 1.21.80 update. This led to an unnoticed failure to update BedrockProtocol in the previous patch release.
- Actually fixed PlayStation issues this time
