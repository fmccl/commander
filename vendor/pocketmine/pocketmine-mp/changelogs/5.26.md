# 5.26.0
Released 22nd March 2025.

This is a minor feature release focused on performance improvements.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Performance
- Significantly improved performance of entity movement. Load testing with item entities showed a 3x increase in the number of entities supported without lag.
- Significantly improved performance of on-ground checks for player movement. This still needs further work, but optimisations implemented in this version should improve performance substantially.
- Updated `pocketmine/nbt` dependency with performance improvements to `TAG_Compound` and `TAG_List` comparison. This should improve performance of inventory-related actions.
- `InventoryTransaction` now avoids useless item clones when processing transactions, which should improve performance of inventory-related actions.

## Dependencies
- `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` has been updated to `36.2.0`, which adds new functions to access some packet fields.
- `pocketmine/nbt` has been updated to `1.1.0`, which improves performance when comparing NBT object trees.

## Gameplay
- Block breaking animation speed now takes into account the following: jumping, being in water, haste, mining fatigue

## Tools
- `blockstate-upgrade-schema-utils.php` now has a new `dump-table` command, which turns a `.bin` palette table file into human-readable text for debugging.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- The following methods have been added:
  - `public RuntimeBlockStateRegistry->hasStateId(int $stateId) : bool` - checks whether the given state ID is registered

### `pocketmine\crafting`
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `CraftingManager::sort()` - this was implicitly internal anyway

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following constants have been added:
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_RESIN`
- The following static properties have been added:
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_RESIN`

### `pocketmine\data\bedrock\block`
- `BlockStateToObjectDeserializer` now permits overriding **deserializers** for Bedrock IDs. This may be useful to implement custom state handling, or to implement missing block variants (such as snow cauldron).
  - This was originally prohibited since 5.0.0. However, there is no technical reason to disallow overriding **deserializers**.
  - Overriding **serializers** is still **not permitted**. Reusing type IDs doesn't make any sense and would break internal design contracts.
  - If you want to make a custom version of a vanilla block, create a custom type ID for it, exactly as you would for a regular custom block.
- The following methods have been added:
  - `public BlockStateToObjectDeserializer->getDeserializerForId(string $id) : ?(\Closure(BlockStateReader) : Block)`

### `pocketmine\data\bedrock\item`
- `ItemDeserializer` now permits overriding **deserializers** for Bedrock IDs. As above, this may be useful to implement custom data handling, or to implement missing variants of existing items.
  - This was originally prohibited since 5.0.0. However, there is no technical reason to disallow overriding **deserializers**.
  - Overriding **serializers** is still **not permitted**. Reusing type IDs doesn't make any sense and would break internal design contracts.
  - As above, if you want to make a custom version of a vanilla item, create a custom type ID for it, exactly as you would for a regular custom item.
- The following methods have been added:
  - `public ItemDeserializer->getDeserializerForId(string $id) : ?(\Closure(SavedItemData) : Item)`

## Internals
- `new $class` is now banned on new internals code by a PHPStan rule. Closures or factory objects should be used instead for greater flexibility and better static analysis.
- `CraftingManager` now uses a more stable hash function for recipe output filtering.
- `ChunkCache` now accepts `int $dimensionId` in the constructor. This may be useful for plugins which implement the nether.
- `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` now precomputes basic collision info about known states for fast paths.
  - This permits specialization for common shapes like cubes and collisionless blocks, which allows skipping complex logic in entity movement calculation. This vastly improves performance.
  - Any block whose class overrides `readStateFromWorld()` or `getModelPositionOffset()` will *not* be optimised.
  - `Block->recalculateCollisionBoxes()` now has a hard requirement not to depend on anything other than available properties. It must not use `World` or its position.
    - This change was problematic for `ChorusPlant`, which used nearby blocks to calculate its collision boxes.
    - Blocks which need nearby blocks should override `readStateFromWorld()` and set dynamic state properties, similar to fences.
    - This design flaw will be corrected with a major change to `Block` internals currently in planning for a future major version.
- `Block->getCollisionBoxes()` may not be called at all during gameplay for blocks with shapes determined to be simple, like cubes and collisionless blocks.
- `BlockStateToObjectDeserializer` now checks if the returned blockstate is registered in `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` to promote earlier error detection (instead of crashing in random code paths).
